Image Processing backend

Created this backend for my React site to run Advanced Algoriths or ML filters on images. Also to add a possiblity to store before and afters on a DB. My site will send the image for enchanced on user input. 

Current Stage: Basic app right now that can get an image and return one. Filters will be added next and improved functionality for different image types.
