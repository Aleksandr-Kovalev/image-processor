Image Processing backend

Created this backend for my React site to run Advanced algorithms or ML filters on images. Also to add a possibility to store before and afters on a DB. My site will send the image for enhanced on user input. 

Current Update: In Development. 3 white balance filters were added and are working.

TODO next: Add the 4th white balance algorithm and add filters to remove noise from photos.
